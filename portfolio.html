        <h3>web security</h3>
        <p><h4>Developed web security</h4> - Web security involves implementing measures to protect websites and web applications from cyber threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This includes safeguarding against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting, as well as employing encryption protocols to secure data in transit. Regular audits, updates, and adherence to security best practices are crucial for maintaining a robust web security posture.</p>
        <p><h4>Technologies used:</h4> SSL/TLS Encryption, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA),Content Security Policy (CSP)</p>
        <p><h4> Title: WebFortify</h4> - Enhancing Web Security"

            <h4>Project Description:</h4> WebFortify is a comprehensive web security project designed to fortify online platforms against cyber threats. By implementing advanced encryption through SSL/TLS, integrating a robust Web Application Firewall (WAF), and enforcing Content Security Policy (CSP), WebFortify ensures the confidentiality and integrity of user data. The project also includes the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for an added layer of user verification. Automated security scans using industry-leading tools identify and address vulnerabilities promptly, while continuous monitoring through Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) strengthens the overall resilience of web applications.</p>
